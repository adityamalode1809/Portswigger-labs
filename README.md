## PortSwigger Lab Projects

This repository contains hands-on web application security testing
performed using the PortSwigger Web Security Academy.

Vulnerabilities are mapped to OWASP Top 10 categories where applicable.

Each lab writeup documents my approach to identifying vulnerable
functionality, validating exploitation, and understanding the
security impact from an attacker’s perspective.

The focus is on practical testing methodology, clear proof of concept,
and realistic remediation aligned with common VAPT and OWASP practices.

All testing was conducted in authorized, controlled lab environments.
